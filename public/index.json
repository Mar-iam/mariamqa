The GATT framework consists of various profiles where each profile composed of one or more services. Each service has a set of characteristics that indicate the properties and operations of the service.\nFor instance, the Heart Rate Profile enables the communication between the Heart Rate Collector and Sensor, where the latter measures the heart rate through the characteristics of the Heart Rate service. The following diagram illustrates the Heart Rate Profile components:\nAll services and characteristics within the GATT framework are identified with a universally unique ID.\nHeart Rate Service Within the HR service, there are four main characteristics:\nCharacteristic Property Heart Rate Measurement (HRM) Notify Body Sensor Location Read Heart Rate Control Point Write HRM Characteristic The HR collector receives a notification from the HRM characteristic whenever the data is available. The measurements are sent on a 23-bytes of data per Bluetooth LE packet, where the first byte is called Flag, and it provides information about the data format.\nHR Data Format: 1-bit that indicates if HR values are in the format of UINT8 or UINT16. Sensor Contact (SC): 2-bits indicating whether the SC feature is supported or not, and if supported whether the device in good or poor contact with the skin. Energy Expended (EE): 1-bit that indicates the presence of the Energy Expended in the HRM characteristic. RR-Intervals (RR): 1-bit that tells whether RR-intervals measurements are present in the HRM characteristic. RFFU: 3-bits Reserved for Future Use HR values Based on the format of the HR data whether it is UINT8 or UINT16, the values can be read as 1 or 2 bytes, resepectively. It can be retrieved from the received data packet starting from the byte followed by the flag. The HR values are measured in beats per minute (bpm).\nRR-Intervals Retrieving RR-intervals from Bluetooth LE packets is not straightforward. Since multiple RR-intervals could be measured between the transmissions of HRM characteristic, the RR-intervals are presented in the sub-fields of the characteristic. The number of sub-fields is determined based on the overall length of the packet, the format of HR values, and the presence of EE. Therefore,\nIf the format of HR values is UINT8, the maximum number of RR-interval values that can be notified with a single HR measurement is: If EE is present, the maximum number of RR-intervals is 8 Otherwise, the maximum number of RR-intervals is 9 If the format of HR values is UINT16, If EE is present, the maximum number of RR-intervals is 7 Otherwise, the maximum number of RR-intervals is 8 Note: the resolution of RR-Intervals is 1/1024 seconds\nRR Extraction Algorithm Check the flag byte for the following: HR Format Presence of EE Availability of RR-Intervals If RR-Intervals are available, then retrieve the data: Combine every two bytes that represent one measurement until the end of the data packet. (RR-Intervals format is UINT16) Convert the measurements to seconds by dividing the RR-Intervals by 1024.

The primary aim was to integrate a scientific visualisation tool, ParaView, with the Data Observatory (DO) at the Data Science Institute to foster data exploration. The DO is a large tiled-display system consisting of 64 screens providing a resolution of over 130 megapixels.\nA snapshot of the inner view of 3D brain model displayed in the DO Implementation The main approach was to split the 3D model, displayed in ParaView, across 64 screens over a distributed clustered network. This was achieved by controlling the viewing camera for each screen and ensuring the alignment of the overall scene. Moreover, the MPI protocol was used to distribute the data rendering and processing over multiple machines.\nEvaluation The integration of ParaView with the DO provided a high-resolution visualisation of scientific models and enabled researchers to collaborate with each other. Therefore, the effectiveness of large display environment as compared with small screens was assessed in terms of evaluating the task performance and collaboration.\nTask Performance:\nA mental rotation task was designed to evaluate the perceptual and cognitive performance of researchers in both environments. It is one of the popular tests that is mainly used to identify the ability to detect orientation change in 3D objects from two perspectives 1. Each participant was asked if the displayed models were the same or mirrored.\nMental rotation task in two cases: (1) The same (2) Mirrored Collaboration:\nIn the collaboration task, the participants were asked to work in pairs and search for hidden objects -represented as coloured arrows- injected inside a 3D brain model while discussing within a limited time.\nFor both tests, the number of correct responses was measured to conduct quantitative analysis. The results showed a significant advantage of using the DO as compared with the typical desktop monitor in the accuracy of the mental rotation and collaborative search tasks.\nR. N. Shepard and J.

The simulation was integrated with a set of vibrators mounted in the back seat to deliver navigational information to the driver.\nHigh-level architecture A set of 10 vibrators were distributed in the back seat based on several experiments to determine the appropriate intensity of vibration, the pattern, and the minimum distinguishable distance. They have been arranged as 4, 2, 4 vibrators in each column. The first two rows corresponded to the “straight” signal, whereas the first and last columns indicated the “left” and “right” signals respectively.\nEvaluation A predefined scenario was designed in the 3D driving environment to navigate the drivers to a certain destination. The overall effectiveness of the vibrotactile seat was measured based on the response time and the number of correct responses as compared with audio-directional feedback. The response time was measured between the time the navigational aid was triggered and the time in which the user responded and took action.\nFurther details about the design of the tactile seat and the study analyses are discussed in the following papers:\n","date":1554432280,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554432280,"objectID":"80d39c123c8d77c54bf0e4514359dc2c","permalink":"https://mariam.qa/project/haptic-seat/","publishdate":"2019-04-05T02:44:40Z","relpermalink":"/project/haptic-seat/","section":"project","summary":"The objective of this project was to develop a vibrotactile seat in a 3D immersive environment to improve driving safety.","tags":["Virtual Reality","Haptic"],"title":"Haptic Seat in 3D Driving Simulation","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Overview The motivation behind this project was to facilitate the learning process of petroleum engineering students by simulating the offshore environment using virtual reality technology.\nTherefore, an interactive oil rig platform has been developed using Vizard VR Toolkit and 3ds Max to create the animation.
